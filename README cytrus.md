## Hosting the bot

### WARNING ABOUT HOSTING
**You are NOT allowed to rebrand the bot as your own creation without the explicit permission of Rexogamer.** If we find a case of someone doing this, we'll try our hardest to ***take it down*** (this makes you a Cytrus-REEEpoff).
You are allowed to self-host it, but your changes **MUST be on GitHub.com**, as a fork of Cytrus-RE **AND credit must be given to the authors of Cytrus-RE.** We'll also need to be able to contact you.

By self-hosting Cytrus-RE, you agree to the above.

### How-to
Use `cd` to navigate into the Cytrus-RE folder, and then run
```bash
npm install
``` 
Create a .env file in the directory Cytrus-RE is installed in. Paste the text below into the .env file:  
```js
BOT_TOKEN='`YourBotToken`'
LOG_WEBHOOK_TOKEN='`YourLogChannelWebhookToken`'
LOG_WEBHOOK_ID='`YourLogChannelWebhookID`'
IPINFO_API_KEY='`YourIpinfo.ioAPIKey`'
GITHUB_TOKEN='`YourGithubToken`'
PREBOOT='/*JavaScript Code*/'
```
Replace the values with your personal, specific info such as the token of the bot. (If you're using a service like Glitch or Heroku, make sure to add a `HOSTNAME` variable. Make sure to write the value in TitleCase.)

Finally, start up Cytrus-RE by running ```node cybase.js```.

To see how to make the bot start up automatically and run without needing a terminal emulator always open, look no further than the official [**discord.js guide**](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html) (not needed if you use Heroku).
